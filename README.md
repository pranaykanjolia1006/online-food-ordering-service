This is a simple java based application on online food ordering service covering major functionalities like order food, prepare food at the restaurant and then deliver the food to the customer.

Main design pattern used is observer design pattern.
This also helped us in avoiding cyclic dependency which could come is restauranat, order and delivery managher are all talking to one another. So that form a commnunication is avoided by having event based mechanism which is implemented using observer design pattern.
